<p>Internal:The Internal CSS stylesheet is a set of styles created as part of an HTML document. Internal CSS is a method for defining CSS styles within an HTML documentâ€™s 'style' element, it is used to provide a unique style for a single HTML document in the 'head' section. This means that the CSS is embedded within thev 'style' tag inside the 'head' section of the HTML file.</p>
